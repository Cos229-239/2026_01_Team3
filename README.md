# My G-Quest:

The core idea is a cross-game companion app, similar in spirit to the Destiny 2 companion app, but designed to work across multiple games instead of being tied to a single title.

Game Profiles: Users select the games they play (e.g., Destiny 2, Fallout, etc.) and see game-specific info in one place.

Vault / Inventory Notes: A lightweight “vault” concept where players can track important items, gear they want to keep, or items they’re chasing.

Weekly Content Tracker: Displays weekly quests, dungeons, raids, or activities per game, including available difficulties and what rewards or loot types they offer, similar to how Destiny shows rotations.

Progress Tracking: Manually track quests, achievements, or personal goals.

Guided Walkthroughs: Step-by-step guides for missions, dungeons, or progression paths, focused on clarity rather than full wiki-style content.

Build / Loadout Notes: Save and reference builds or loadouts using notes and images (not full stat calculators).

From a design standpoint, I’m imagining a clean dashboard-style UI:
